# Green Screen Video Processing Web App

## About
This is a simple web app made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It uses the webcam to capture live video and replaces the green background with any image or video chosen by the user.

## Objective
To understand how the **green screen (chromakey)** effect works and how to do it in a web browser.

## How It Works
1. Click **Start Camera** to allow webcam access.  
2. Choose a **background image or video** using the file input.  
3. The app removes the green color from your video and shows the selected background instead.  
4. You can also pause and resume the video.

## Files Used
- `index.html` → Structure of the webpage  
- `style.css` → Styling the page  
- `script.js` → Main JavaScript logic  
- `README.md` → Project information  

## How to Run
1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.  
2. Right-click on `index.html` → click **"Open with Live Server"**.  
3. Allow the **camera** when asked.  
4. The app will start working.

## Tools and Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Browser APIs (for webcam)

## Learning Outcome
I learned how to:
- Use webcam in a web page  
- Detect green color and make it transparent  
- Replace it with another background  
- Work with canvas and video in JavaScript
